Learning about having :
    1.dynamic content in modals
    2. focus - concept
    3. some css for such conditions
    4. keyboard accessibility - tabindex -1, tabindex 0 ,
    5. .focus()

point 1 2,4, being very informative and good learning curve.
see how keydown event listener is used.
 observe how e.key for 'Tab' and e.key for 'Escape' is used and e.shiftKey is used directly for shiftkey . refer mdn for these

This was quite a learning.


in element selection , it need not always be document.getEle etc
if we have a element ,div , say divModal , we can use divModal.querySelectorAll to get hold of all child elements inside that div.
