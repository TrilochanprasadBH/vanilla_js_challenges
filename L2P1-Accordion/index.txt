Learning why i made choices i made in code:

1. this.classlist .add or .remove or .contains or .toggle

2. in css for accordion content we use maxHeight :0 and overflow:hidden, we do not use display :none,
because display none, does not help us in having smooth transition effect, as it removes element from dom, but maxHeight :0 and overflow:hidden, keeps element, ie technically it's there but not visible, now this allows us to apply transition effects better

3. see how 'this' is used in this js logic, such a nice real example.
