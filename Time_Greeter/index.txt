Objective: Create a webpage that displays a greeting ("Good Morning," "Good Afternoon," or "Good Evening") based on the current time of day.

<script src="index.js"></script>: Placed at the end of <body> so the HTML elements (like greetingDisplay) are loaded and available when the script runs.
In some cases we use DomContentLoaded

Learnt about css js connection
DomContentLoaded and using ES6 heavy code from now, for example i did not use if-else for conditions , i used ternary operator ?:  , this avoided using let {can be reassigned}, and i used only const variables making code robust.

Though for simple use case like this if-else is fine , or readability reduces.
